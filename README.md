## Project Structure

```
TaskGo/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go           # Entry point and main logic.
â”œâ”€â”€ todo.go           # Todo structure and related methods.
â”œâ”€â”€ storage.go        # Persistent JSON storage implementation.
â”œâ”€â”€ command.go        # Command-line flag handling.
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod            # Module file.
â””â”€â”€ todos.json        # Sample data file.
```

## Key Concepts

- **Todos Management**: All todos are stored in a slice of structs with fields like `Title`, `Completed`, and timestamps for creation and completion.
- **JSON Storage**: Utilizes Go's encoding/json package for saving and loading todos in a readable format.
- **CLI Flags**: Built with the `flag` package, enabling simple yet powerful command-line operations.
- **Tabular Display**: Employs the [aquasecurity/table](https://github.com/aquasecurity/table) package for a clean, formatted output.

## Future Enhancements

- Add search functionality for tasks.
- Include deadlines and prioritization.
- Introduce task categorization.
- Add unit tests for robust testing.
